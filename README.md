# Vithoba Flashcards
Vithoba is a Flashcard Tool built in Python. It has weight-functionality, so the cards don't just rotate randomly. To add a Flash Card simply go to the Manage Menu by clicking on the `...` Button in the bottom left corner and create a new one with the green Add Button.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation
ðŸ”½ Download the **ZIP** with the green **Code** button and get the *Vithoba-main* folder out of the **ZIP**.

You'll most likely need to type this into the `Terminal` (Visual Studio Code), as you need `PyQt6`:

    pip install pyqt6

If not working, try:

    py -m pip install pyqt6

â–¶ **To start, just open the gui.py file.**

The font used is `Inter`, you'll have to install it on your own: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
Of course, `Python` itself is required: https://www.python.org/downloads/
